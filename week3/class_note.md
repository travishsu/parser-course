# Networked Programs
## Communicate with Internet
 - Transport Control Protocol (TCP)
    - App (Client) -> Transport (Client)  -> Transport (Server) -> App (Server) -> Transport (Server) -> Transport (Client) -> App (Client)
 - 簡言之!
    - App (Client) -> Socket -> App (Server) -> Socket -> App (Client)
